Selfsurfing
===========

Selfsurfing is a Chrome extension that creates a self-surfing, auto-updating clone of my browser in real time. 

My browser has a server extension installed which transmits the current state of my browser to a intermediate server, which holds all relevant information. This information is then picked up by Selfsurfing extension.
